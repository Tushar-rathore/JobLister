# JobLister
Developed a job listing platform using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. This platform allows users to add, post, delete, search, and update job requirements and store data in the database, using my knowledge of REST API for efficient CRUD operations. The backend is built with Spring Boot for scalability, and MongoDB is used for effective data management.
